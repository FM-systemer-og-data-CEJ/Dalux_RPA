# Overview

## Introduction

This project is about automatically interacting with Dalux based on observable changes. So, we have an "observer", if there is a change and this change is in the observers parameters, it will do an action. 

## Features

- Observe workorders
- React to changes in workorders
  - Copy value from a field to another field
